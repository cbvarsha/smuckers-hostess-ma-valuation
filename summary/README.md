## Executive Summary

This project evaluates Smucker’s acquisition of Hostess Brands using
DCF valuation, WACC, and scenario analysis.

The base-case intrinsic value of $35.76 per share exceeds the offer
price of $34.25, resulting in a positive NPV of $171.5M. Low shareholder
value at risk indicates limited downside even if synergies fail.

Overall, the transaction is financially sound, strategically aligned
with growth in snacking, and value-accretive for shareholders.
